By default, * this client silently recovers from the following problems: * &lt;ul&gt; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreachable IP addresses.&lt;/strong&gt; If the URL's host has multiple IP addresses, * failure to reach any individual IP address doesn't fail the overall request. This can * increase availability of multi-homed services. * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stale pooled connections.&lt;/strong&gt; The {@link ConnectionPool} reuses sockets * to decrease request latency, but these connections will occasionally time out. * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreachable proxy servers.&lt;/strong&gt; A {@link ProxySelector} can be used to * attempt multiple proxy servers in sequence, eventually falling back to a direct * connection. * &lt;/ul&gt; * Set this to false to avoid retrying requests when doing so is destructive. In this case the * calling application should do its own recovery of connectivity failures." />

This accommodates special-purpose * queues such as DelayQueues for which poll() is allowed to * return null even if it may later return non-null when delays * expire." />

If you would like to instead allow the * document to be kept in recents so that it can be re-launched, you can use * this flag. When set and the task's activity is finished, the recents * entry will remain in the interface for the user to re-launch it, like a * recents entry for a top-level application." />

Invoking this method to delete a file or * directory that is already registered for deletion has no effect. * Deletion will be attempted only for normal termination of the * virtual machine, as defined by the Java Language Specification. * * &lt;p&gt; Once deletion has been requested, it is not possible to cancel the * request. This method should therefore be used with care. * * &lt;P&gt; * Note: this method should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be used for file-locking, as * the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The * {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock FileLock} * facility should be used instead. * * &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note that on Android, the application lifecycle does not include VM termination, * so calling this method will not ensure that files are deleted&lt;/i&gt;. Instead, you should * use the most appropriate out of: * &lt;ul&gt; * &lt;li&gt;Use a {@code finally} clause to manually invoke {@link #delete}. * &lt;li&gt;Maintain your own set of files to delete, and process it at an appropriate point * in your application's lifecycle. * &lt;li&gt;Use the Unix trick of deleting the file as soon as all readers and writers have * opened it. No new readers/writers will be able to access the file, but all existing * ones will still have access until the last one closes the file." />
