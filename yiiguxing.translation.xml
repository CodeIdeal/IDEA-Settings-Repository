      <item value="The context of this scope. * Context is encapsulated by the scope and used for implementation of coroutine builders that are extensions on the scope. * Accessing this property in general code is not recommended for any purposes except accessing the [Job] instance for advanced usages. * * By convention, should contain an instance of a [job][Job] to enforce structured concurrency." />

      <item value="When using collections (eg. {@link ListView}, {@link StackView} etc.) in widgets, it is very * costly to set PendingIntents on the individual items, and is hence not permitted. Instead * a single PendingIntent template can be set on the collection, see {@link * RemoteViews#setPendingIntentTemplate(int, PendingIntent)}, and the individual on-click * action of a given item can be distinguished by setting a fillInIntent on that item. The * fillInIntent is then combined with the PendingIntent template in order to determine the final * intent which will be executed when the item is clicked. This works as follows: any fields * which are left blank in the PendingIntent template, but are provided by the fillInIntent * will be overwritten, and the resulting PendingIntent will be used. The rest * of the PendingIntent template will then be filled in with the associated fields that are * set in fillInIntent. See {@link Intent#fillIn(Intent, int)} for more details." />
