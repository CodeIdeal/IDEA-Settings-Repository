By default, * this client silently recovers from the following problems: * &lt;ul&gt; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreachable IP addresses.&lt;/strong&gt; If the URL's host has multiple IP addresses, * failure to reach any individual IP address doesn't fail the overall request. This can * increase availability of multi-homed services. * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stale pooled connections.&lt;/strong&gt; The {@link ConnectionPool} reuses sockets * to decrease request latency, but these connections will occasionally time out. * &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreachable proxy servers.&lt;/strong&gt; A {@link ProxySelector} can be used to * attempt multiple proxy servers in sequence, eventually falling back to a direct * connection. * &lt;/ul&gt; * Set this to false to avoid retrying requests when doing so is destructive. In this case the * calling application should do its own recovery of connectivity failures." />

This accommodates special-purpose * queues such as DelayQueues for which poll() is allowed to * return null even if it may later return non-null when delays * expire." />
