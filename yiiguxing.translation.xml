      <item value="Paint flag that enables bilinear sampling on scaled bitmaps. * * &lt;p&gt;If cleared, scaled bitmaps will be drawn with nearest neighbor * sampling, likely resulting in artifacts.

      <item value="Whether or not bilinear filtering should be used when scaling the * bitmap. If this is true then bilinear filtering will be used when * scaling which has better image quality at the cost of worse performance. * If this is false then nearest-neighbor scaling is used instead which * will have worse image quality but is faster. Recommended default * is to set filter to 'true' as the cost of bilinear filtering is * typically minimal and the improved image quality is significant." />
